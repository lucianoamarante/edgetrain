## Introduction

In today's world, data privacy is a top concern. EdgeTrain addresses this by allowing neural network training to occur directly on user devices. This approach minimizes data transfer and enhances privacy while still delivering robust performance.

EdgeTrain uses WebGPU, a modern API for high-performance graphics and computation on the web. This makes it suitable for deep learning tasks in a browser environment.

## Features

- **On-Device Training**: Train models directly on user devices, ensuring data privacy.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Achieve low-latency processing for immediate results.
- **Federated Learning Support**: Collaborate across devices without sharing raw data.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on any device with a modern browser.
- **Open Source**: Freely available for anyone to use and contribute.
- **JavaScript and TypeScript Support**: Easily integrate into existing web applications.

## Usage

### Basic Example

To get started with training a simple neural network, you can use the following code snippet:

```javascript
import { NeuralNetwork } from 'edgetrain';

const model = new NeuralNetwork({
    layers: [
        { type: 'input', size: 784 },
        { type: 'dense', size: 128, activation: 'relu' },
        { type: 'output', size: 10, activation: 'softmax' }
    ]
});

// Load your data
const trainingData = loadTrainingData();

// Train the model
model.train(trainingData, {
    epochs: 10,
    batchSize: 32,
    learningRate: 0.01
}).then(() => {
    console.log('Training complete!');
});
```

### Advanced Configuration

EdgeTrain allows for more advanced configurations. You can customize the optimizer, loss functions, and other parameters. Here’s an example:

```javascript
const model = new NeuralNetwork({
    layers: [
        { type: 'input', size: 784 },
        { type: 'dense', size: 256, activation: 'relu' },
        { type: 'dense', size: 128, activation: 'relu' },
        { type: 'output', size: 10, activation: 'softmax' }
    ],
    optimizer: 'adam',
    loss: 'categoricalCrossentropy'
});

// Train with more complex data
const complexData = loadComplexTrainingData();

model.train(complexData, {
    epochs: 20,
    batchSize: 64,
    learningRate: 0.001
}).then(() => {
    console.log('Complex training complete!');
});
```
